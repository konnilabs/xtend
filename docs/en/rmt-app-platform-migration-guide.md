# RMT App Platform Migration Guide

Move larger app structures to the RMT app platform APIs.

## What it covers

RMT App Platform Migration Guide describes the public RMT surface for this page: which records are involved, which adapters exercise them and which scheduler signals a host should verify.

## Public building blocks

- `.rmt` sources.
- Core records and source maps.
- Host adapters for DOM, router and components.

## Recommended workflow

Start RMT App Platform Migration Guide with the smallest record example, validate it with the linter and only then attach adapters for host data, routing or components.

## Next steps

- [XTendRMT overview](./xtendrmt-overview.md)
- [RMT Authoring Guide](./rmt-vnext-authoring.md)
- [RMT Linter](./rmt-linter.md)
- [RMT Language Server](./rmt-language-server.md)

## Public contract

RMT App Platform Migration Guide is the public RMT runtime contract for `docs/en/rmt-app-platform-migration-guide.md`. The stable signal is not article length; it is whether an external host can verify the named files, names and checks without private project knowledge.

- Role: explains which decision an integrator can make from this page.
- Stable surface: RMT records, compiler output, runtime adapters, events, actions and scheduler lanes.
- Not promised: Private runtime internals, generated DOM structures and internal planning terms stay outside the public contract.

## Interfaces and anchors

These anchors are concrete enough for a third-party developer to verify behavior locally:

Sources:
- `docs/en/rmt-app-platform-migration-guide.md`
- `docs/menu.json`
- `package.json`
- `docs/xtendrmt-docs-shell-vnext.rmt`
- `tools/rmt-language/parser.js`
- `tools/rmt-language/vnext-compiler.js`
- `tools/rmt-language/vnext-scheduler.js`
- `tools/rmt-language/vnext-surfaces.js`

Names:
- `docs/en/rmt-app-platform-migration-guide.md`
- `docs/menu.json`
- `docs/xtendrmt-docs-shell-vnext.rmt`
- `tools/rmt-language/parser.js`
- `tools/rmt-language/vnext-compiler.js`
- `tools/rmt-language/vnext-scheduler.js`
- `tools/rmt-language/vnext-surfaces.js`
- `docs/dev-router.php`
- `package.json`
- `node scripts/run_xtend_tests.js rmt-stack-docs rmt-playground-docs --json`

Commands:
- `node scripts/run_xtend_tests.js rmt-stack-docs rmt-playground-docs --json`
- `node scripts/run_xtend_tests.js rmt-linter-cli rmt-language-server --json`

## Minimal verification path

Run this check when the article, an example or the named public surface changes:

```bash
node scripts/run_xtend_tests.js rmt-stack-docs rmt-playground-docs --json
node scripts/run_xtend_tests.js rmt-linter-cli rmt-language-server --json
```

- Expected signal: The command must finish without link errors, without known boilerplate and with concrete anchors in the article.
- Sources: If source and article disagree, source wins; then update both locales with identical code blocks.

## Specific failure modes

- If runtime behavior differs, separate compiler record, host adapter and scheduler signal before changing the docs.
- If a link from this article breaks, repair the local Markdown target path and then run `node scripts/verify_docs_public_quality.js`.
- If an example is copied, file paths, record names and commands from this section must stay runnable as written.

# XTendRMT Migration Guide

Migration from hand-written host logic to declarative RMT records.

## What it covers

RMT describes app structure, interaction and runtime intent. The kernel stays host-neutral; adapters connect records to XTend UI, XRouter, Fabric and your environment.

## Public building blocks

- `.rmt` sources.
- Core records and source maps.
- Host adapters for DOM, router and components.

## Recommended workflow

Model shell, state and interaction first. Validate the source with the linter, connect adapters afterwards and keep host-specific code outside the kernel.
